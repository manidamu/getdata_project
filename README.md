## Get data course project 

# Project purpose 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with,and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project.

You will be required to submit: 

* a tidy data set as described below, 
* a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 
* a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md

You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
